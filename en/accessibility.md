### Accessibility

While components are usually implemented with accessibility in mind,
sometimes it may be necessary to define special attributes like aria. In
menu //Tools /// _More_ following commands are available:

- _Add accessibility_ – adds new properties "Aria label" and "Role" to
  selected component(s) in property group "Accessibility"
- *Remove accessibilit*y – removes properties added by previous
  command
- _Accessibility report_ – shows report of all components that have
  these properties
